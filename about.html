      <h3>Software Developer</h3>
      <p>
        I've been a developer for about 6 years now and throughout these years I learned
        some languages, solved some problems and made some friends. I started as a full
        stack developer I'm specializing in
        backend development and I made some small projects in Nodejs, C# and Golang.
      </p>

      <h3>Full Stack Internship</h3>
      <h4>May 2018 - December 2018</h4>
      <p>
        During this period I worked in some projects that were pretty difficult for me at
        the time because I didn't have experience with any of the languages. I developed in
        Nativescript (a hybrid framework) using Typescript for backend and XML for frontend
        and I was responsible for the entire workflow of this project, developing new pages,
        working on backend processes, creating new APIs as well as maintaining the project
        and publishing the app in Apple Store And Google Store.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also worked in another project that was made in PHP using Phalcon framework and I
        had to do a lot of backend development which took me some months to figure it out,
        understand the architecture and the workflow, but once I got rhythm I became a
        fullstack developer in that team, working with HTML, CSS and Javascript JQuery and
        maintaining the backend workflow.
      </p>

      <h3>Trainee Developer</h3>
      <h4>January 2019 - December 2019</h4>
      <p>
        After getting more experience in Mobile development I began to participate in
        sprint plannings for new features, helping the team to decide what solution would
        work best for our apps and this time I worked in multiple mobile projects, creating
        new features, maintaining and publishing the apps in the stores.
      </p>

      <h3>Junior Developer</h3>
      <h4>January 2020 - September 2020</h4>

      <p>
        In this period I had all the previous responsibilities, but I started to participate
        in web projects, helping the team in the planning and development of web platforms,
        working in new features and maintaining multiple projects including some legacy
        projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, I began to tackle with cloud infrastructure, plugins and tools creation
        using PHP, Javascript, Typescript and Python as well.
      </p>

      <h3>Mid-Level Developer</h3>
      <h4>October 2020 - February 2022</h4>

      <p>
        At this point I've worked in most of the projects of the company. I participated in
        the planning and creation of major features for the most recent platforms, creating
        tools to communicate with third party software as well as helping and developing
        solutions for bigger partners.
      </p>

      <p>
        I took part in the development of a new Data Analytics project that was developed 
        in ASP.NET and we deployed it locally using Docker and further we used our Cloud 
        environment (AWS) to better integrate it with the rest of our projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        This solution helped the decision making of our leaders as it could store data about 
        multiple processes and projects of the company. This platform could show earnings 
        with dynamic date range, our applications minimum, average and peak connections, our 
        Customer Service received calls and all of that data gave us valuable info that 
        allowed our teams to optimize their processes and workflows. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As our teams grew we saw the need to find a more efficient way to show and demonstrate 
        to new employees how our main projects worked. We decided to introduce a weekly meeting 
        to gather our developers and present our projects to them. That strategy turned out to 
        be a big a success within the company and then we expanded to becoming a small 
        innovation summit that someone would present a new coding language, framework, process 
        or any other tech innovation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time me and my leader would bring these new tech to the table, here are some 
        examples:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Face recognition algorithm for authentication at the entrance of the company using 
            Python 3 and a neural network library.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Analytics algorithm and project using C# and ASP.NET.
          </li>
          <li>
            Javascript and Typescript canvas for creativity purposes for our employees.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ways of improving and tuning projects in Laravel, ASP.NET for better performance and 
            connection stability on Linux machines in Cloud (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and Azure) or 
            local (Apache2, Nginx and Redis).
          </li>
        </ul>
